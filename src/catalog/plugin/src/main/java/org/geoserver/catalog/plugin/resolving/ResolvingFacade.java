/**
 * Interface that defines methods for applying resolution functions to objects of type {@code T}
 * both inbound and outbound, enabling customizable object transformation in a catalog context.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides a generic framework for processing objects (typically {@link CatalogInfo})
 * entering and exiting a facade, using configurable {@link UnaryOperator} functions. The outbound resolver
 * transforms objects before they are returned to the caller, while the inbound resolver processes objects
 * received from the caller before they are passed to the underlying implementation. By default, both
 * resolvers are set to the {@link UnaryOperator#identity() identity} function, meaning no transformation
 * occurs unless explicitly configured via {@link #setOutboundResolver(UnaryOperator)} or
 * {@link #setInboundResolver(UnaryOperator)}.
 *
 * <p>Key features:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Flexible Resolution:</strong> Supports custom inbound and outbound transformations, such
 *       as resolving proxies or initializing properties.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Null Safety:</strong> Requires resolvers to handle null inputs, allowing implementations
 *       to decide how to process or propagate nulls.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Pipeline Composition:</strong> Encourages chaining functions to build complex resolution
 *       workflows tailored to specific needs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementations (e.g., catalog facades) must apply {@link #resolveOutbound(T)} to every object returned
 * and {@link #resolveInbound(T)} to every object received, ensuring consistent transformation across all
 * operations.
 *
 * <p>Example usage for a catalog facade:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Catalog catalog = ...;
 * UnaryOperator<CatalogInfo> resolvingFunction =
 *     CatalogPropertyResolver.of(catalog)
 *         .andThen(ResolvingProxyResolver.of(catalog))
 *         .andThen(CollectionPropertiesInitializer.instance())
 *         .andThen(ModificationProxyDecorator.wrap());
 *
 * ResolvingFacade<CatalogInfo> facade = ...;
 * facade.setOutboundResolver(resolvingFunction);
 * facade.setInboundResolver(ModificationProxyDecorator.unwrap());
 * }
 * </pre>
 * This pipeline sets the catalog property (e.g., {@link ResourceInfo#setCatalog}), resolves
 * {@link ResolvingProxy} references, initializes null collections, and wraps objects in a
 * {@link ModificationProxy} for outbound objects, while unwrapping proxies for inbound objects.
 *
 * <p>Notes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Resolvers must accept {@code null} as an argument and may return {@code null}, giving
 *       implementations flexibility in handling missing or unresolved objects.</li>
 *   <li>Callers must ensure resolvers use the correct {@link Catalog} instance if required by the
 *       chained functions, as this interface remains agnostic to such dependencies.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of objects to resolve (typically {@link CatalogInfo} or a subtype).
 * @since 1.0
 * @see CatalogInfo
 * @see ResolvingProxyResolver
 * @see ModificationProxyDecorator
