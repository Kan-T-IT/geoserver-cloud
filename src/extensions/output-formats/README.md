# GeoServer Cloud Output Format Extensions

This directory contains extensions for additional output formats in GeoServer Cloud:

## Vector Tiles

The Vector Tiles extension adds support for various vector tile formats including:
- Mapbox Vector Tiles
- GeoJSON Vector Tiles
- TopoJSON Vector Tiles

Vector tiles are a way to deliver geographic data to a browser or other client application in small chunks that can be efficiently rendered and styled on the client side.

## Future Extensions

Additional output format extensions may be added here in the future, such as:
- KML
- CSV
- GeoPackage output
- Additional vector and raster output formats
